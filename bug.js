In Next.js 15, a subtle issue can arise when using the `app` directory's layout component with dynamic routing and data fetching.  If the layout fetches data based on a route parameter, and that parameter isn't available during the initial render (e.g., due to client-side routing), the component might throw an error because it attempts to access data before it's been fetched.  This usually manifests as a hydration mismatch error.
